            <p>The OSS Taxonomy helps to classify a Free and Open-Source (FOSS) project. It is important because classification of a project shows the relationships between it and its contemporaries. It also helps the user to compare between similar projects and choose one that best suits their need. Classification of a project is one of the prerequisites before it can be compared and ranked in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p><small>To achieve this goal, OSSRank has defined an initial set of categories and associated a set of keywords with them. These categories and keywords are continously updated as new generation technologies or project types appear.</small></p>
            <p><small>The following categories are currently analyzed and supported by <em>OSSRank</em>:</small></p>
            <ul>
                <li ng-repeat="x in categories">
                    <em>{{ x.name }}</em>
